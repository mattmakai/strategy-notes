What Is Strategy?
-----------------
* operational effectiveness is performing similar activites *better* than rivals perform them
* operational effectiveness includes efficiency and any way to better use inputs to produce a better output
* operational effectiveness is not strategy
* strategic positioning is about different activities or performing activities in different ways
* activities are the basic unit of competitive advantage
* overall competitive advantage is derived from all activities performed, not just a few
